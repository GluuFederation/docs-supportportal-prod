# Support Portal User Guide

The Gluu Support Portal is designed to provide a community knowledge base as well as a support solution for Gluu customers and free open source users of the Gluu Server. You can browse public tickets for solutions or you can submit a request to the community if you can't find answers to your questions.

Please review our [ticket submission guide](https://github.com/GluuFederation/support-portal-docs/blob/master/sources/user-guide/how-to-ask.md) before opening a ticket. 

If you are associated with a Gluu customer account, register using your organization specific email to unlock customer privileges such as the ability to enlist private support, set ticket priorities, attach files to tickets, and collaborate with your colleagues and certified Gluu partners on support requests. 

# Finding information in the Support Portal

## Front-end
You can use the front-end global search to find existing public (or your organization's private) tickets that may be related to your question. As you type, predictive search results are displayed to help you find relevant content. If you are looking for a ticket regarding a specific topic, such as integrations, you can also select a category to search within to narrow down results. Once you click the search button, results will be displayed in a single list. You can sort the search results by any of the columns. 

## Back-end 
As a registered user on the support portal you will have access to your own dashboard. From within the dashboard you can search, sort, and filter tickets created by (or on behalf of) yourself. If you are associated with a customer organization, you can also search, sort, and filter your colleagues public and private support requests.

# Adding / Removing Named Contacts

If you are the lead point of contact at a Gluu customer organization, you have the ability to add and remove your colleagues as supported contacts. Named contacts are limited based on the support plan your organization has purchased with Gluu. For an overview of support entitlements, you can view the [Gluu support matrix](http://gluu.org/entitlements). 

# Adding / Removing Partner organizations

If you are the lead point of contact at a Gluu customer organization, you have the ability to add and remove certified Gluu partners from your account. Certified Gluu partners are organizations that have been vetted by Gluu, and engaged by your organization to assist with your Gluu server integrations and operations.

Adding a certified partner organization will enable all authorized contacts at the partner organization to see your organizations private tickets, and to create tickets on behalf of you and your colleagues. This will allow you to more seamlessly work with partner organizations and Gluu support to resolve issues relating to your authentication and authorization service.
