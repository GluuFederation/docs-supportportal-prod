# Gluu Support Portal Documentation
The Gluu Support portal provides a place where both Gluu customers and the community can get answers for questions about Gluu Server operations, customizations, integrations and more.

People from organizations that pay for Gluu support can open private tickets, set ticket priorities, upload files, collaborate with team members on private tickets, and more. If you are currently a community user and would like to become a supported customer, please review our support pricing then schedule a meeting.
