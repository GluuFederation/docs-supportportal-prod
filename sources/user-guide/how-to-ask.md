# How to ask a good question on Gluu Support 

## Search, and research

...and keep track of what you find. Even if you don't find a useful answer elsewhere on the site, including links to related questions that haven't helped can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest.

## Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

The title is the first thing potential answerers will see, and if your title isn't interesting, they won't read the rest. So make it count:

Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site.

Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important! Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. If you're not comfortable writing in English, ask a friend to proof-read it for you.

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

## Introduce the problem before you post any code

In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible.

## Help others reproduce the problem

Not all questions benefit from including code. But if your problem is with code written by you or Gluu, you should include some. But don't just copy in your entire program! Not only is this likely to get you in trouble if you're posting your employer's code, it likely includes a lot of irrelevant details that readers will need to ignore when trying to reproduce the problem. 

If it is possible to create a live example of the problem that you can link to (for example, on http://sqlfiddle.com/ or http://jsbin.com/) then do so - but also include the code in your question itself. Not everyone can access external sites, and the links may break over time.

## Include all relevant logs 

When it comes to troubleshooting issues in the Gluu Server--from service hiccups to outages--your server logs are the best place to gather relevant information. The Gluu Server administrator can investigate logs in the oxTrust server GUI or directly with SSH access to the Gluu-Server container. Upload or provide a link with a copy of all relevant logs. Learn more about logs produced in the Gluu Server in our [documentation](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.1/operation/logs/). 
The best way to share logs is through an attachment--not in the markdown editor. Supported customers can upload attachments during ticket and answer creation. Non-supported customers should use a service like pastebin or google drive to share log files.   
   
## Include screenshots

Including screenshots will help people better understand and diagnose the issue. If you are associated with a supported customer, you can upload screenshots directly on your ticket. If you are not able to upload directly to the ticket, use an external service and include links in your ticket. 

## Don't post to GitHub... 

In order to keep issues centralized and organized, please report all bugs and issues on the support portal. If your issue is in fact the result of a bug in the code someone from Gluu will move the issue to the proper GitHub repository.
