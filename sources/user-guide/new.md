## Submitting a support request

You must be signed in to submit support requests in Help Center.

To submit a support request in Help Center

Click New Ticket at the top of the page.

Enter a subject and description of the problem.
As you enter a subject, a list of suggested articles in the knowledge base appears. You can click one of the articles instead of submitting the request. Encouraging end-users to look for answers in the knowledge base can deflect tickets.

If you belong to multiple organizations, select the organization for this support request.

Add any attachments.

The file size limits are 1 MB for Essential, 7 MB for Team, and 20 MB for Professional and Enterprise.

#### To track your support requests:

2. To see a filtered view of all your open requests, click the Open tickets link in the left-hand menu.

3. To see a filtered view of all your closed requests, click the Closed tickets link in the left-hand menu.

4. To see details about a request, hover your mouse over the info icon next to your name. 

5. To search your tickets, use the search bar in the right hand corner. 

6. To sort tickets by one of the table categories, simply click the arrow once or twice.

7. To further refine tickets, you can expand the advanced flters dropdown.

## Tracking your organization's tickets

If you're a member of a Gluu customer organization, you can see tickets for all other members of that organization. 

> Note: Supported Gluu customers have a limited number of "named contacts" that can interact with Gluu staff for support. The Basic support plan includes 4 named contacts, Premium includes 6 named contacts, and Enterprise includes 8 named contacts. Additional named contacts can be purchased for $199/user/month.

#### To track your organization's support requests (customers and parnters only)

1. Click your profile icon on the upper-right side of any page, and then click My Dashobard. By default, the page displays all requests that you have submitted. 

2. Using the left-hand menu, navigate to the "Company Tickets" section. 

3. To see details about tickets, and to search, sort, and filter tickets, follow the [above instructions](#to-track-your-support-requests). 

## Updating ticket status

As you work through issues you may need to update the status of the ticket. There are two ways to update a ticket:

1. In the left hand window you can change the ticket status as needed. Be sure to save your edit before navigating to another page.

2. During a response to a ticket you can update a ticket status. When you submit the response, the ticket's status will be updated as necessary.

> Note. If you simply wish to close your ticket, click the Close button in the left hand menu.  

## Creating a follow-up to a solved request

You can comment on or reopen a closed ticket, or create a new ticket that references the former ticket.
