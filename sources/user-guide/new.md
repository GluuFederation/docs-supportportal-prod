## Submitting a support request

You must be signed in to submit support requests in Help Center.

Note: The new ticket form might display less fields than those described in this section. The fields you see will depend on whether you have a free, paid, or partner account. 

To submit a support request in Help Center

Click New Ticket at the top of the page.

Enter a subject and description of the problem.
As you enter a subject, a list of suggested articles in the knowledge base appears. You can click one of the articles instead of submitting the request. Encouraging end-users to look for answers in the knowledge base can deflect tickets.

If you belong to multiple organizations, select the organization for this support request.

Add any attachments.

The file size limits are 1 MB for Essential, 7 MB for Team, and 20 MB for Professional and Enterprise.
