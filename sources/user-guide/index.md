# Support Portal User Guide

The Gluu Support Portal is designed to provide a community knowledge base as well as a support solution for Gluu customers and free open source users of the Gluu Server. You can browse public tickets for solutions or you can submit a request to the community if you can't find answers to your questions.

**Please review our [ticket submission guide](./how-to-ask.md) before opening a ticket.** 

If you are associated with a Gluu customer account, register using your organization specific email to unlock customer privileges such as the ability to enlist private support, set ticket priorities, attach files to tickets, and collaborate with your colleagues and certified Gluu partners on support requests. 

## Search 

### Front-end
You can use the front-end global search to find existing public (or your organization's private) tickets that may be related to your question. As you type, predictive search results are displayed to help you find existing relevant content. If you are looking for a ticket regarding a specific topic, such as integrations, you can also select a category to search within to narrow down results. Once you click the search button, results will be displayed in a list. You can sort the search results by any of the columns.

### Back-end 
As a registered user on the support portal you will have access to your own dashboard. From within the dashboard you can search, sort, and filter tickets created by (or on behalf of) yourself. If you are associated with a customer organization, you can also search, sort, and filter your colleagues public and private support requests.

In order to use advanced filters navigate to your user dashboard and click the "Show advanced filters" menu bar. This will expand the menu and display available filters.

> Supported Gluu customers have a limited number of "named contacts" that can interact with Gluu staff for support. The Basic support plan includes 4 named contacts, Premium includes 6 named contacts, and Enterprise includes 8 named contacts. Additional named contacts can be purchased for $199/user/month.

![dashboard-company-tickets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/support-portal-docs/master/sources/img/dashboard-company-tickets.png)

1. Click your profile icon on the upper-right side of any page, and then click My Dashobard. By default, the page displays all requests that you have submitted. 

2. Using the left-hand menu, navigate to the "Company Tickets" section. 

3. To see details about tickets, and to search, sort, and filter tickets, follow the [above instructions](#to-track-your-support-requests). 

### Tracking your customer's tickets 
*Partners only*

If you're a member of a Gluu partner organization, and a Gluu customer has granted you access to their tickets, you can view their tickets in your dashboard. Once a Gluu customer grants your organization's access to their tickets, you'll see a section in the left-hand menu of your Dashboard that specifies "Partner Companies" with a specific link for each customer organization that has given your organization access to their tickets.

## Notifications 

Each ticket is subject to its own notifications. If you are the ticket creator you are automatically subscribed to those notifications. If you wish to receive notifications, or stop receiving notifications for a specific ticket, navigate to the ticket in question and click the blue button that either says `Send me alerts` or `Remove me from alerts` depending on your existing alerts setting.  

![ticket-alerts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/support-portal-docs/master/sources/img/ticket-alerts.png)

## Adding / Removing Named Contacts 
*Customers & Partners only*

If you are the lead point of contact at a Gluu customer organization (a.k.a. the Account Admin), you have the ability to add and remove your colleagues as supported contacts. Named contacts are limited based on the support plan your organization has purchased from Gluu. For an overview of support entitlements, you can view the [Gluu support matrix](http://gluu.org/entitlements). 
![add-removing-named-contacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/support-portal-docs/master/sources/img/add-removing-named-contacts.png)

There are two ways to remove existing Named Contacts from your organization:

1) Make Basic User: this downgrades the user's status from Named User to regular User. The user will no longer be able to see and open tickets on the company's behalf, and will lose the ability to create private tickets, upload attachments, and set ticket priority. 

2) Deactivate Account: this will completely deactivate the users account. If the user tries to login to Gluu support using this account they will get an error message telling them their account has been deactivated. 

Of the two options, deactivating the account is more severe and should be used when the user in question should no longer have an account associated with the customer organization. 

## Adding / Removing Partner organizations 
*Customers & Partners only*

If you are the Account Admin, you have the ability to add and remove certified Gluu partners from your account. Certified Gluu partners are organizations that have been vetted by Gluu, and engaged by your organization to assist with your Gluu server integrations and operations.

Adding a certified partner organization will enable all authorized contacts at the partner organization to see your organizations private tickets, and to create tickets on behalf of you and your colleagues. This will allow you to more seamlessly work with partner organizations and Gluu support to resolve issues relating to your authentication and authorization service.
