# Support Portal User Guide

The Gluu support portal is designed to be a community knowledge base, as well as a support solution for Gluu customers. 

Anyone can browse and open public tickets on Gluu Support. Gluu customers can create private tickets, share tickets with colleagues, and will receive priority assistance from Gluu's support staff. 

## User Roles and Privileges

Community: Community users can open public tickets and browse existing public tickets. Responses from Gluu support are not guaranteed, but we do our best to respond in a timely manner. 

Named Contact (customer): Named Contacts can open private tickets for their organization, share tickets with colleagues, schedule support and consultative calls, upload files to tickets, and expect faster responses and more detailed assistance from Gluu support.

Admin Contact (customer): Account Admins are primary contacts for the customer. They have all the privileges of a Named Contact, plus the ability to add and remove named contacts from their organization. In addition, they can authorize certified Gluu partner organization's to interact with Gluu support on their behalf (if necessary).

## Search 

### Front-end
You can use the front-end global search to find existing public (or your organization's private) tickets that may be related to your question. As you type, predictive search results are displayed to help you find existing relevant content. If you are looking for a ticket regarding a specific topic, such as integrations, you can also select a category to search within to narrow down results. Once you click the search button, results will be displayed in a list. You can sort the search results by any of the columns.

If you are associated with a customer organization, you can also search, sort, and filter your colleagues public and private support requests.

### Tracking your customer's tickets 
*Partners only*

If you're a member of a Gluu partner organization, and a Gluu customer has granted you access to their tickets, you can view their tickets in your dashboard. Once a Gluu customer grants your organization's access to their tickets, you'll see a section in the left-hand menu of your Dashboard that specifies "Partner Companies" with a specific link for each customer organization that has given your organization access to their tickets.

## Notifications 

Each ticket is subject to its own notifications. If you are the ticket creator you are automatically subscribed to those notifications. If you wish to receive notifications, or stop receiving notifications for a specific ticket, navigate to the ticket in question and click the blue button that either says `Send me alerts` or `Remove me from alerts` depending on your existing alerts setting.

## Managing Named Contacts 
*Customers & Partners only*

If you are the lead point of contact at a Gluu customer organization (a.k.a. the Account Admin), you have the ability to add and remove your colleagues as supported contacts. Named contacts can open private tickets, share tickets with colleagues, schedule support and consultative calls, upload files to tickets, and expect faster responses and more detailed assistance from Gluu support.

Named contacts are limited based on the support plan your organization has purchased from Gluu. 

|Basic Support|Standard Support|Premium Support|Enterprise Support|
| ------------- |:-------------:|--------:| -----:|
|2|4|6|8|

For a complete overview of support entitlements see the [Gluu support matrix](http://gluu.org/entitlements). 

You can manage named contacts at: [https://support.gluu.org/dashboard/company-users/](https://support.gluu.org/dashboard/company-users/). 

[![add-removing-named-contacts](../img/add-removing-named-contacts.png)](../img/add-removing-named-contacts.png)

### Adding Named Contacts
In order to add a colleague to the list of named contacts, simply enter the persons email in the `Invite via Email` field. Click the `Submit` button and the person will receive an email invitation to join your organization's account on Gluu Support. If the person already has an account on Gluu Support, their account will be upgraded upon their next login. 

### Removing Named Contacts
There are two ways to remove existing Named Contacts from your organization:

1) Make Basic User: this downgrades the user's role from a Named User to a regular User. The user will no longer be able to see and open tickets on the company's behalf, their tickets will no longer be subject to the SLAs in the support contract, and they will lose the ability to create private tickets and upload attachments. They will go back to being a community user on Gluu Support. 

2) Deactivate Account: this will completely deactivate the users account. If the user tries to login to Gluu support using this account they will get a page that tells them their account has been deactivated. 

Of the two options, deactivating the account is more severe and should be used when the user in question should no longer have an account associated with the customer organization. 

To manage named contacts for your organization, login to the support portal and visit [https://support.gluu.org/dashboard/company-users/](https://support.gluu.org/dashboard/company-users/).

## Managing Admin Contacts

Each customer organization should delegate one or more people to act as their Gluu Support account admin. An accound admin has all the privileges of a named contact plus the ability to manage named contacts and authorize certified Gluu Partner organization's to interact with their private tickets (as necessary).

If at any point in time the admin privilege needs to be shifted, or if your organization wants multiple people to have admin contact privileges, the existing admin contact can make any other named contact an account admin via the Mange Users page in the support dashboard. 

Simply navigate to `https://support.gluu.org/dashboard/company-users/`, and click the "Make Account Admin" link for the appropriate user. The next time they sign in they will have admin contact privileges. 

If the existing account admin should be removed, they can transfer admin privileges to another named contact and the new account admin can then remove the users admin status, and deactivate or downgrade the user as necessary.

## Managing Partner organizations 
*Customers & Partners only*

If you are the Account Admin, you have the ability to add and remove certified Gluu partners from your account. Certified Gluu partners are organizations that have been vetted by Gluu, and engaged by your organization to assist with your Gluu server integrations and operations.

Adding a certified partner organization will enable all authorized contacts at the partner organization to see your organizations private tickets, and to create tickets on behalf of you and your colleagues. This will allow you to more seamlessly work with partner organizations and Gluu support to resolve issues relating to your authentication and authorization service.

## Book Meetings
*Customers & Partners only*

Support and review calls are included with all VIP support contracts. To schedule a call with Gluu navigate to the Book Meetings section of your Gluu support dashboard. If you'd like help troubleshooting a specific implementation issue, book a support call. For high level security reviews, design discussions, etc., book a review call.
